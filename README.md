    ```javascript
    const products = [
        {
            id: 1,
            name: "Product Name",
            price: 99.99,
            image: "path/to/image.jpg",
            description: "Product description here."
        },
        // More products...
    ];
    ```

3. Add a new object for each product you want to include. Make sure to specify the `id`, `name`, `price`, `image`, and `description`.
4. Save the file and refresh your browser to see the new products on the website.
